# The GYM

[View the live project here!](https://mohamed-hagabdalla.github.io/Portfolio-One/)

**The GYM** is a website aimed at those who are interested in improving their fitness by joining a gym. In the first section, the user can find a promotion offer, benefits of joining, a list of equipment offered and opening hours. There is an about us section, which provides the user with more information about what they can expect by joining, accompanied by images of existing members in the gym. The final section is the contact section, in which the user can provide their full name and email address and they will be contacted to discuss any matters further.

## Features

There are a few features that enhance the user's experience. For example, a navigation bar, images, contact form and a footer.

### Navigation Bar

- This is located at the top right hand corner of the page.
- They navigate the user to different sections of the page. For instance, the 'About Us' section and the 'Contact' section.
- Enables them to view different sections on the webpage without having to manually scroll each time.

### Images

- Images have been included to give the user a view of the gym and how training sessions will look.
- Shows them the experience of existing members.

### Contact Form

- This form allows users to provide their contact details to discuss any further enquiries before purchasing a membership.
- Allows them to ensure they are willing to purchase a membership, as they will be contacted.

### Footer

- This contains links to social media sites for **The GYM** that open in a new tab, so the user does not have to go back to the website everytime.
- Encourages the user to keep up to date with the latest news and offers.

## Testing

Talk about testing here. Talk about website features and make sure they work well, how the website looks on different screen sizes, any problems that occurred when testing.

## Validator Testing

To ensure my HTML and CSS codes ran smoothly and had no errors, I tested for validation. I tested each code and more information on how I tested them is explained below in more detail.

1. HTML
-  No errors were found when I ran my HTML code on the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

2. CSS
- No errors were found when I ran my CSS code on the [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## Unfixed Bugs

Talk about unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. Include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.

## Deployment

The website was deployed to GitHub pages. To successfully deploy my website, I took the following steps:

1. Ensure the relevant respository is loaded and select the settings tab.
2. Navigate to the pages tab (the second-last option on the left hand side).
3. Select the main branch, the root folder and click save.
4. Refresh the page and a message should appear, telling you that your site has been published.
5. The website has successfuly been deployed.
